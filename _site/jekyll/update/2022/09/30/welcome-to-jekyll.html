    <p>IT Book summaries is a site to read about and learn many books that are being written today. The books I am reviewing will mainly be non-fiction and of an Educational theme. They will cover many different subject areas</p>

<p>Please allow me to introduce myself to you - Phil Cregeen. I am an IT professional in Wellington New Zealand and have a passion for reading books. I consider educating yourself an essential part of the modern workplace. With the rate of change occurring not just in IT but in the world generally, I am really keen to build a community of like-minded people to share opinions and to help each other.</p>

<p>One issue I have these days is that I am time-poor. I therefore wanted to provide a basis for people who love to read different books, but might want to read the book reviews and summaries first before investing in purchasing the book themselves. Books are expensive today, but there are alternatives (through libraries, or services like Amazon Prime) to get your hands on these texts. I can help however!</p>

<p>I aim to do this in a number of ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>write a review of the books the myself where I have time.</li>
  <li>identify great summaries of the books - often from good external sources.
These can be a great way to understand the main points the author was trying to convey without having to necessarily read the entire book yourself.</li>
  <li>encourage you to email me back with your thoughts, if you have read the books, on the subject area itself or if you just want to share your thoughts with a community of like-minded people.</li>
</ol>

<p>All the books will be categorised and stored on this website, so you can return to them again. I will be adding to these over time - so be sure to keep coming back.</p>

<p>Thanks for your interest and time, and I very much look forward to hearing from you!</p>

<p>Phil.</p>

<p>Also, please note I do not receive any commission money from these books.</p>
