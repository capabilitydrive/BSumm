| <img src="/BSumm/imgs/phil.jpg" alt="Phil Cregeen picture"> | Hi my name is Phil Cregeen and I work in Wellington New Zealand as a Contract Business Analyst and Product Owner. I also develop websites in my spare time - like this one. This website is part of a broader initiative called Capability Drive which you can find at [capabilitydrive.com](https://www.capabilitydrive.com/){:target="\_blank"}

Most of us do not have time to read alot of business books. When I walk into the business reference section of my local bookstore, I love the idea of digesting many (not all) of these books. This blog website is basically me going through to manually curate the best free book summaries on the web, so you can at least get insight into the book, maybe before you would consider purchasing it even? <br><br>Books are expensive in some countries and alot of people cannot afford the originals, so here seems like a good alternative to get some ideas across a broad array of subjects. I fully intend to keep updating the site with many books - some related to Information Technology (computers) but not necessarily. Even IT people need to work on their wellness for example!<br><br>I hope you enjoy and please email me with any comments you may have?<br><br>

All the best<br>
Phil.
